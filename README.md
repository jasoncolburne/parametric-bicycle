# Parametric Bicycle

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This is still in progress. I relied heavily on Claude to research the components in `/specs`, I will probably modify the list once I do some more research.

You can check `geometry.scad` and play around with rider height, reach, and stack. Those change the shape of the bicycle.

I plan to attempt to fabricate one of these on a FibreSeeker 3 and Nestworks C500.

Also check out the Makefile. You'll need a newer version of OpenSCAD, and if you render in the app you should enable the Manifold backend, if possible, for massive performance gains.
